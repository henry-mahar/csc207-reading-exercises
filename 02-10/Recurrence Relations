T'(0) = 0
T'(n) = 1 + T(n -2)

1) Express in terms of k, the number of unfoldings
T(n) = k + T(n - 2k)

2) Find where n = k
T(n - 2k) = T(n/2 - k) = T(0)

T(n) = n/2 + T(0)
T(n) = n/2

The result is linear. Our result does not change if we subtract any constant k.
It will always result in linear complexity.
